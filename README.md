# Memory Card
A simple memory game built using [react](https://reactjs.org/) to put into test my **functional components** and **hooks**' knowledge. Despite its simplicity, I really like how the visual design of the page came out.
## Instructions
There are 12 different pictures of astronomical objects and the goal is to click on every single one of them **without repeating**. If you select a card you've selected before the score resets back to 0 and the game **starts over**.

The trick is that when you click on an image, all the cards **get shuffled**.
